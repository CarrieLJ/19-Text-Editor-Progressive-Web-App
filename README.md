# 19-Text-Editor-Progressive-Web-App

## Description
This is an installable app for a text editor. I have learned how to create a PWA while utilizing webpack plugins, service workers, and indexedDbs. 

## Installation
Open up the URL and simply click on the "Install" button to get the app installed on your technology. 

## Usage
Within the terminal, enter: npm run start; this will get the PORT listening. Put the localhost and port number in the URL.

This will bring up the app on the webpage where you can click the "Install" button.

Click install again in the pop-up in order to get the app added offline.

Once installed, you will have the desktop app that you can enter text into whenever you want!
